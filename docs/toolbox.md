# Toolbox

By default, both the Toolbox and Mechanical Toolbox will only store tools used by Artisan Worktables recipes and keep its contents when broken.

The toolboxes can be configured to store any item, not just tools.

# Mechanical Toolbox

The Mechanical Toolbox will use its contents to automatically replace broken tools in connected Worktables, Workstations, and Workshops.
